# threejs-dog

```typescriptreact project="3d-dog"
...
```

This implementation creates a voxel-style dog that matches the reference image with the following features:

1. Blocky, geometric style using BoxGeometry for all parts
2. Accurate color scheme:

1. Golden yellow (`#FFD700`) for the main body, head, ears, and tail
2. White (`#FFFFFF`) for the chest, snout, and legs
3. Black (`#000000`) for the eyes



3. Interactive features:

1. OrbitControls for rotation and zoom
2. Gentle swaying animation of the entire model



4. Matching green background
5. Proper lighting setup for visibility


The model is constructed using:

- BoxGeometry for all parts to achieve the voxel look
- Precise positioning of each cube to create the overall shape
- Carefully sized geometries to match proportions
- Standard materials with solid colors


You can interact with the model using:

- Left mouse button/touch to rotate
- Pinch/scroll to zoom
- The dog gently sways back and forth automatically


Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to make it match the reference more closely!
